        <p> MY SPECIALIZATION.</p>
    </section>
            
    </section>
    <p>As a 4th-year high school student at Antique National School, I'm part of the Special Program in the Arts (SPA) with a major in Visual Arts. Interestingly, being part of SPA wasn't initially part of my plan. Despite having limited experience in drawing and painting, I took a leap of faith and chose Visual Arts as my major. Throughout my elementary years, I never actively explored my artistic side through activities like poster-making or art competitions. However, as I embarked on this journey, I began to uncover my hidden talents and grew into my passion for the arts.

Embracing this journey has allowed me to overcome initial doubts and develop skills that have exceeded my expectations. I'm incredibly proud of my progress and grateful for the opportunities that SPA has provided. Through this program, I've not only honed my artistic skills but also discovered a sense of purpose and confidence.</p>
    <p>These six artworks represent some of my favorite pieces from grades 7-10. I've created many artworks throughout my journey, but these stand out to me as particularly meaningful. Each piece required a significant investment of time and effort, and I recall struggling to bring my vision to life at first. However, as I persisted and continued to hone my skills, I noticed a significant improvement in my art style and technique. My artworks evolved from simple creations to more realistic and detailed pieces.

I'm grateful to have overcome my initial doubts and insecurities, which allowed me to grow and develop as an artist. With each new piece, I pushed myself to try new techniques, explore different mediums, and refine my craft. Looking back, I'm proud of the progress I've made and excited to see where my artistic journey takes me next.</p>
<p>These artworks represent my journey as an artist from grade 7 to 4th year high school. Each piece holds a special memory and showcases my growth and improvement.</p>

<p>This artwork from grade 7 was my first major project, and I recall spending a significant amount of time on it. Although it was challenging, I was happy to have completed it.</p>

<p>The following year, in grade 8, I created this artwork. While it was still a struggle, I managed to finish it on time and was pleased to see my skills improving.</p>

            <p><img src="5ee9ee7a-d18b-4b9f-a7a1-65482f31c493.jfif" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>In grade 9, I faced a new challenge with this artwork. Initially, I struggled to find the right reference, but eventually, I found it on social media. Despite my busy schedule, I completed the piece within 11 days, and I was grateful to see significant improvement in my skills.</p>

              <p><img src="3c25a34a-d4e2-45c7-9b27-4ede33b31fa0.jfif" width="500" height="500"></p>

<p>Currently, as a 4th-year high school student, I've created these two artworks, which are among my favorites. I spent a considerable amount of time perfecting them, aiming for realism and detail. I'm thrilled to see how far I've come, and I'm thankful for the talent that I've been given.</p>

<p>This artwork, also from grade 9, holds a special memory. I was asked to create it, and I finished it on stage during our school's "Dinihon" event, accompanied by my classmate who played the violin while I painted.</p>
