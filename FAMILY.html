        <p>My family is very important part of my life. When I was 11 years old, my parents are already separated. However they have made countless sacrifices to provide us with everything we need and want. They work hard so that we can live a good life and have a good education to achieve our dreams. I have two brothers and five sisters, making us a family of eight. I am the seventh child, or the second to youngest. 

<p>My father, Wilson N. Quanico. He is a very supportive, caring, and passionate about football. He told me that during high school, he excelled as an athlete and even competed in regional competitions in the West. He is also known for his hardworking nature, discipline for our family. Despite the separation within our family, he always strives to give us a comfortable life. He has taught me the value of determination and perseverance, and even in the toughest of times, he finds a way to meet our needs. I am grateful to have him as my father.</p>


<p>My mother, Maria Arleen M. Quanico. She is very caring, responsible, supportive, patient, and strong. She always taught us the importance of being responsible, humble, kind, and thoughtful. she also puts others before herself. She is my role model, and she is always there for me when I need her. She's a source of love, guidance, and wisdom in my life, she also sacrifice a lot for us. Despite being exhausted from her work at times, she still manages to find time for  checking on us to ensure that we are okay. For all these reasons, I am incredibly grateful to have her as my mother.</p>

<p>I have seven siblings, consisting of five sisters and two brothers. My oldest sister(Christine) is already married and has two talented and cute babies, which is my niece. My second oldest sister(Christel) is working at Antique Airport (passenger service agent). My brother(Curth) he loves to ride and play motorcross. My brother (christian) and my two sisters (Chrizel)&(Charise) they're already in college and studying at University of Antique and Aims at pasay. And me (Cynthia) I loves to paint, draw, and play guitar. I'm in 4th year highschool and in special program in the arts, major in visual. Finally my youngest sister(Chelsea), she's smart, pretty and caring, she's also talented. She likes to sing, she is now in second year highschool, special program in the arts, major in music.</p>


<p> They are nurturing, affectionate, and provide support whenever it's needed. Even though we may have our disagreements at times, they still show care and concern for one another. They're also my best friends and we share a strong bond. .</p>
