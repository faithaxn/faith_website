        <h1>PRE-SCHOOL</h1>
        <p>Although my memories of preschool are vague, one moment stands out. I vividly recall feeling proud and happy when my teacher gave me a star for good behavior and completing activities on time. That small recognition sparked joy and encouraged me to continue being diligent and well-behaved.</p>

      <h1>ELEMENTARY </h1>
      <p>My elementary years were truly unforgettable, filled with laughter, friendship, and growth. I'm grateful to have shared this journey with my friends, classmates, and dedicated teachers. We created lifelong memories together, from playing various games during recess to exploring our creativity in art classes.

One of the highlights of my elementary years was the strong bond I formed with my classmates. We would often play together during free time, inventing our own games or participating in friendly competitions. Our teachers, who became like mentors to us, encouraged our curiosity and supported our development.

Those carefree days were filled with joy, excitement, and discovery. I cherish the memories of our class outings, school events, and simple moments of friendship. My elementary experience laid the foundation for my future academic journey and instilled in me the importance of friendship, teamwork, and resilience.</p>

      <h1>HIGHSCHOOL </h1>
      <p>My high school journey has been an incredible adventure, filled with exploration, discovery, and growth. It's been a time of trying new things, learning from my experiences, and exploring my passions. One of the highlights of this journey has been forming meaningful connections with new friends who have supported and encouraged me along the way.

Academically, I've had the opportunity to enhance my skills in the arts, particularly in visual arts. Being part of the Special Program in the Arts (SPA) with a major in Visual Arts has allowed me to delve deeper into my creativity, experiment with different techniques, and develop my unique style.

Through this program, I've not only honed my artistic skills but also developed valuable skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and time management. I'm grateful for the experience and look forward to continuing to grow and explore my artistic passions.</p>
